In this lab, you will build a function that returns an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

The function should return an array containing the largest number from each sub-array. */

function largestOfAll(arr){
  let res=[];
  for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    res.push(arr[i].sort((a,b)=>b-a)[0]);
  }
  return res;
}
largestOfAll([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]])
